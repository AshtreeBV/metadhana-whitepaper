# Token Sale Rounds

Instead of the traditional sale rounds that occur in a given period of time, each targetting a specific group of investors, whitelisted addresses, private and close-door transactions.

The team decided to have token sale packages for the presale rounds instead. Each package will be offered to presale investors with its own discounted price. There would be no limit to the amount that investors are willing to put in for a share of the protocolâ€™s tokenomics.

This idea is made possible by having a different type of vesting schedule that would be discussed later on.

## Presale Packages

Token presale would be open to everyone and it would remain open for a specific time period. The team has a soft cap target of $(\_\_\_) funds to be raised to ensure the protocol has enough financial cushion for its launch. However, the team has no hard cap and would welcome all investments in the protocol.

Below is a table of the presale packages along with its discounted prices.
