# Staking (sToken)

Staking is a long-term strategy that uses a derivative of the main token, sToken, that allows ‘stakers’ to earn more tokens. In order to stake, a user must lock the main Token in exchange for sToken that allows him to earn more sToken.

The ratio of sToken to Token is always honored on a 1 to 1 basis.

To claim the main Token from sToken, sToken must be burnt and pay a fee equivalent to the main token’s intrinsic value, per sToken. The fee goes directly to the protocol’s treasury.

\[
1 \text{ }Token = 1 \text{ }sToken + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]

If the current Token price is $10, then the value gained by the staker is $9.98 upon swap. To make it attractive for users to stake tokens, a high APY would be offered.

Paying an intrinsic fee is necessary for the protocol to maintain its claim that each Token is backed by its intrinsic value.

Staking benefits both the staker by earning additional tokens, and the protocol by increasing its token supply while keeping each token backed as well as increasing PCV.
