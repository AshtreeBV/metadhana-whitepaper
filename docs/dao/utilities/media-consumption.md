# Media Consumption (r|w|cTOKENs)

A concept derived from the gaming mechanism (play-to-earn), expanding into other forms of leisure (i.e. Reading and Watching) and even a chat-to-earn feature that allows the project to target a wider audience that fancies reading and watching media content.

Read-to-Earn, Watch-to-Earn, and Chat-to-Earn will each have their own TOKEN derivative represented by rTOKEN, wTOKEN, and cTOKEN respectively. Claiming these tokens as rewards follows the same process in claiming gTOKEN.

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }rTOKEN + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }wTOKEN + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }cTOKEN + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]
