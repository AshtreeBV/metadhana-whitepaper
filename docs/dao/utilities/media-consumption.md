# Media Consumption (r|w|cTokens)

A concept derived from the gaming mechanism (play-to-earn), expanding into other forms of leisure (i.e. Reading and Watching) that allows the project to target a wider audience that fancies reading and watching media content.

Read-to-Earn, and Watch-to-Earn, will each have their own token derivative represented by rToken and wToken, respectively. Claiming these tokens as rewards follows the same process in claiming gToken, wherein the claimant burns rToken and/or wToken and pays a fee equivalent to the main tokenâ€™s intrinsic value to mint the main Token.

\[
1 \text{ }Token = 1 \text{ }rToken + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]

\[
1 \text{ }Token = 1 \text{ }wToken + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]

\[
1 \text{ }Token = 1 \text{ }cToken + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]
