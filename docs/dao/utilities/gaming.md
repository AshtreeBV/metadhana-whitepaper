# Gaming (gTOKEN)

Gaming is another strategy to earn tokens. The structure is the same with staking but it can be a long-term or short-term strategy depending on how you play it. In order to earn gTOKEN, the user must own a MetaDhana NFT, and use it to play our games.

Gaming TOKEN, gTOKEN is another derivative of the main TOKEN that is used to reward players for their achievements, rankings, playing time, (Yes, we reward those players who devote time and play our games), and more!

Unlike sTOKEN, gTOKEN wonâ€™t earn you more tokens by holding it, meaning gTOKEN is not eligible for staking. Instead, gTOKEN is given to players as rewards. Converting gTOKEN to TOKEN requires a fee that is equivalent to TOKEN's intrinsic value, per gTOKEN converted.

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }gTOKEN + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]
