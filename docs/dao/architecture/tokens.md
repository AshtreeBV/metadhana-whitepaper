# Tokens

The protocol would have the main token and token derivatives derived from the main token. Each token derivative will have its unique use case and role to solidify the DAOâ€™s base layer or foundation, each use case is only unique to a specific token and is not interchangeable. Each token is honored at a 1 to 1 ratio with the main token.
