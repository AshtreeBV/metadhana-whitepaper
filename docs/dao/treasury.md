# Treasury

The Protocol's Treasury acts like a vault where assets are locked to back the intrinsic value of the Main Token. Assets in the treasury would consist of mostly Stablecoins, some Blue-Chip NFTs, and top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

The DAO would explore other assets that provide revenue opportunities such as DeFI protocols, stocks, and real-world assets. In addition, fees gathered from DeFI products such as DEX, Marketplace, and others will directly be stored in the treasury.

### How Tokens are Backed?

The Main token is unlimited in supply with an auto mint and auto burn feature that depends on the value in the protocol’s treasury. If the value of the protocol’s treasury is at Php 1,000,000 then the token supply would be at 1,000,000 regardless of its price.

If the total value of treasury decreases to Php 800,000 then 200,000 tokens would be burned and reduce circulating supply to 800,000 regardless of its price. The same is true when the values of assets in treasury increase, then total token supply will increase at the same amount.
