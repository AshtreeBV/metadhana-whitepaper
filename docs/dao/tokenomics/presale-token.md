# Presale TOKEN (pTOKEN)

The presale TOKEN, pTOKEN, is a precursor derivative of the main TOKEN. Just like any other TOKEN derivative, the ratio of pTOKEN to TOKEN is honored at 1:1. Everyone is eligible for the presale.

The team has a soft cap of $4,000,000, and a hard cap of $15,000,000. The number of presale TOKENs cannot be specified at the moment but would be publicly released once the presale period has ended.

Whatever the amount of pTOKEN raised during the presale round will account for 7% of the Total Supply of the main TOKEN.

$$
pTOKEN_{Investors} = \frac{Raised\text{ }Funds}{Presale\text{ }Discount}
$$

The Team’s share will be represented by pTOKEN as well, hence it follows the pTOKEN’s vesting schedule. The team’s share will account for 8% of the Total Supply of the main TOKEN.

$$
pTOKEN_{Team} = \left(\frac{pTOKEN_{Investors}}{7\text{%}}\right) * 8\text{%}
$$

The Team and Investors share diminishes once the TOKEN supply passes the number where all pTOKEN can be vested, meaning the percentage of the DAO increases. In the chart below, the percentage-share of Team and Investors are constant until passing the point "All Vested" (i.e. all pTOKEN are vested). To keep it simple, as the supply of TOKEN increases, the share of Investors and Team in the tokenomics decreases while the DAO percentage share increases.

## Fund Allocation

**88%** of the funds raised in Presale will be used to cover the costs of each TOKEN minted at TGE backed by its Intrinsic Value, and used for Initial Liquidity. The remaining **22%** will be used to cover the cost of the project's continuous development. These numbers are not final, most likely the allocation to have more liquidity will be increased before TGE.
