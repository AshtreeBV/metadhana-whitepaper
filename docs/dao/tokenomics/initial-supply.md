# Initial Supply

The initial supply of the TOKEN would depend on the number of presale TOKEN (pTOKEN) raised during the presale round, specifically at 10% of the total number of pTOKEN raised.

$$
TOKEN_{TGE} = \left(pTOKEN_{Investors} + pTOKEN_{Team}\right) * 10\text{%}
$$

The token allocation during the time period between TGE (Initial Supply) to a certain point wherein all pTOKEN are vested, represented by , is shown in the chart below.

The allocation is as follows:

1. Team: 7%
2. Presale Investors: 3%
3. DAO: 90%

Nonetheless, as mentioned earlier, once the TOKEN supply passes the amount needed for all pTOKEN to be vested, the percentage share of DAO increases from 90%.
