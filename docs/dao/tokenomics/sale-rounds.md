# Token Sale Rounds

The team decided to have token sale packages for the presale rounds instead of the traditional sale rounds that occur in a given period of time, each targetting a specific group of investors, whitelisted addresses, private and close-door transactions.

Each package will be offered to presale investors with its own discounted price and there is no limit to the amount that investors are willing to invest. This idea is made possible by having a different type of vesting schedule that would be discussed later on.

## Converting pTOKEN to TOKEN

To be clear, presale investors will receive Presale TOKEN (pTOKEN). This would be converted to TOKEN by swapping pTOKEN to TOKEN and paying the Intrinsic Value of each TOKEN. Please refer to the formula below

\[
1 \text{ }TOKEN = 1 \text{ }gTOKEN + Intrinsic \text{ }Value
\]

In the presale packages table, the percentage gained from investing in the presale takes into account the cost to convert pTOKEN to TOKEN, and is presented below.

## Presale Packages

The table below shows the current state of our presale packages, values may still change in the future.

Investors are allowed to purchase any number of packages from the given outline. Major and Minor Investors will be featured on our investor page but the amount that each investor bought will be kept private.

Nevertheless, total raised funds will be shown publicly.

## Vesting Schedule

Team and Investors’ pTOKEN vesting schedule depends on the current total supply of the main TOKEN. The amount vested is equal to 15% of the TOKEN supply. This means that at 10 million TOKEN supply, a maximum of 1,500,000 pTOKEN can be redeemed. At 100 million TOKEN supply, it’s 15 million pTOKEN redeemed.

All pTOKEN holders finish vesting anywhere between 4 Billion to 16 Billion TOKEN supply, depending on funds raised between the soft and hard cap values. There’s a lot of upside for holders, but it is dependent on the actual growth of the protocol.

## Example Situation of Vesting Schedule

**Assumptions**

- pTOKEN bought by Investor = 300,000,000
- Amount invested by Investor = $4,000,000

**Solve**

- pTOKEN share of Team is,

$$
pTOKEN_{Team} = \left(\frac{300,000,000}{7\text{%}}\right) * 8\text{%} = \mathbf{342,857,143}
$$

- Total pTOKEN is

$$
pTOKEN = 300,000,000 + 342,857,143 = \mathbf{642,857,143}
$$

- Initial TOKEN supply is

$$
TOKEN_{TGE} = \left(300,000,000 + 342,857,143\right) * 20\text{%} = \mathbf{128,571,429}
$$

Given the Initial TOKEN supply (TGE) here are its corresponding vesting schedule:

</center>

In our example, when the TOKEN supply reaches 4,667,142,857 then all pTOKEN can be converted to TOKEN. TOKEN supply continuous to grow after the 4.7 Billion mark, however, all pTOKEN are vested. Therefore, percentage-share of DAO increases over time, while Team and Investors shares decreases over time.
