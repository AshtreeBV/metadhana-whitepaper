# Token Sale Rounds

Instead of the traditional sale rounds that occur in a given period of time, each targetting a specific group of investors, whitelisted addresses, private and close-door transactions.

The team decided to have token sale packages for the presale rounds instead. Each package will be offered to presale investors with its own discounted price. There would be no limit to the amount that investors are willing to put in for a share of the protocol’s tokenomics.

This idea is made possible by having a different type of vesting schedule that would be discussed later on.

## Presale Packages

Token presale would be open to everyone and it would remain open for a specific time period. The team has a soft cap target regarding funds to be raised to ensure the protocol has enough financial cushion for its launch. However, the team has no hard cap and would welcome all investments in the protocol.

Below is a table of the presale packages along with its discounted prices.

| Presale Packages ($) | Discount (%) | Presale Price ($) | Public Sale Price ($) | Gain on Public Sale Price (%) |

Investors are allowed to purchase any number of packages from the given outline. Investors that bought packages above $100,000 will be featured on our investor page.

Investors that bought one of the first four (4) packages will have the option to place their name or institution on the minor-investors page.

The amount that each investor bought will be kept private. Nevertheless, total raised funds will be shown publicly.

## Vesting Schedule

[Tokenomics Allocation - Team, Investors, etc.] pToken cumulatively vest as 10% of Token supply. This means that at 10 million Token supply, a maximum of 1,000,000 pToken can be redeemed. At 100 million Token supply, it’s 10 million pToken redeemed.

All pToken holders finish vesting anywhere from (soft cap/10%) to (actual raised/10%) token supply, so this is a long-term bet. There’s a lot of upside for holders, but it is dependent on the actual growth of the protocol.
