# Tokenomics

In this section, we provide the details regarding token supply, presale token rounds, vesting schedule, and other information relevant to the token.

## Token Supply

As mentioned earlier, token supply would be unlimited and would depend on how the protocol grows alongside its community. It was also mentioned that total supply will be based on the token’s intrinsic value that is locked in the protocol’s treasury, with an auto mint and auto burn feature depending on the assets in the treasury.

To have an idea of the TOKEN’s supply we first need to understand the relation of presale TOKEN (pTOKEN) to TOKEN, and TOKEN’s Initial Supply.

## Minting

Tokens will be minted when derivative tokens are exchanged for the main Token. In order to keep each minted token backed, based on its intrinsic value, a fee must be paid for each new token minted. That fee will go to the treasury.

## Burning

There will be other token burns to be implemented in the future. The current burn mechanism we have is that whenever the value of the assets in the treasury falls below the number of Circulating Token multiplied by its Intrinsic Value, then the decrease in treasury value would be the number of tokens burnt.
