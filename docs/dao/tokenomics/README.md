# Tokenomics

In this section, we provide the details regarding token supply, sale rounds, vesting schedule, and other information relevant to the tokens.

## Token Supply

As mentioned earlier, token supply would be unlimited and would depend on how the protocol grows alongside its community. It was also mentioned that total supply will be based on the token’s intrinsic value that is locked in the protocol’s treasury, with an auto mint and auto burn feature depending on the value of assets in the treasury.

Assets can be subdivided into multiple categories namely, Presale assets, Team Provided assets, Fees from swapping token derivatives to the main token.

\[
Token \text{ }Supply = f(Presale,\text{ }Team,\text{ }Fees)
\]

Nonetheless, we can still determine the token’s initial supply based on the initial value of the assets to be locked in the treasury.

Fees can only be added when the protocol is live. Therefore, the initial supply is a function of the assets to be initially locked inside.

\[
Initital \text{ }Token \text{ }Supply = f(Presale,\text{ }Team)
\]

Team provided assets would come from a percentage (%) of the NFT sale rounds.

## Minting

Tokens will be minted when derivative tokens are exchanged for the main Token, and in order to keep each minted token backed based on its intrinsic value a fee must be paid for the minter.

## Burning

There will be other token burns to be implemented in the future. The current burn mechanism we have is that whenever the value of the assets in the treasury falls below the number of Circulating Token multiplied by its Intrinsic Value, then the decrease in treasury value would be the number of tokens burnt.
